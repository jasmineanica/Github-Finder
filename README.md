# Github Finder
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/jasmineanica/Github-Finder/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jasmineanica/Github-Finder/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

A React app to search and view Github profiles.

This app was created with the intention of learning React in a well-rounded way. Inspired by a course project taught by [bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). Differences include: added an extra feature in the homepage and used github actions to deploy to github pages instead of deploying to netlify.
